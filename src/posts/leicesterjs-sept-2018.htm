	<h2>Free beer and pizza at the LeicesterJS meet up</h2>
	<p>On the 6th September we attended the inaugural LeicesterJS meet up at CloudCall in the city centre.</p>
	<p>We were met at the door by representatives from CloudCall who showed us the way and welcomed us with a fridge full
		of beers!</p>

	<p>Having been to similar meet ups in the education sector, it was an unexpected addition, and set the tone for a more
		casual evening of discussion.</p>
	<p>There seemed to be several pockets of people attending who already knew each other from various projects or
		previous meet ups. However, our host Josh Ghent, did a great job at making us feel welcome in the time before the
		talks started.</p>
	<p>The room quickly filled up with only two or three empty seats when our first speaker, Craig Russell, took to the
		podium.</p>

	<p>Craig led a talk discussing some of the differences between using a monolith and a microservice architecture.</p>
	<blockquote>‚ÄúMonoliths have a reputation as being the old ‚Äòsocks and sandals‚Äô way and microservices are ‚Äònew and
		sexy‚Äô.‚Äù</blockquote>
	<p>His message was that, even though there‚Äôs a lot of talk about microservices happening in the tech community at the
		moment, it is not always prudent to jump straight in there. He talked about starting with a monolith, so that you
		could observe and understand how your application structure was going to evolve. Really, you need a firm grasp of how
		your processes are going to interact with each other before you can start splitting them off into useful
		microservices. Start with a monolith, and when it starts getting too big - that‚Äôs when you can break it down into
		smaller microservices.</p>
	<p>
		He used the analogy of pets vs cattle to highlight changes in managing infrastructure between the two architectures.
		He talked about how people can become sentimental about their monolith servers. He asked if anyone had named any of
		their old servers and was met by a sea of hands held in agreement. Monoliths can become like pets once we‚Äôve looked
		after them for a long time, but microservices are more like cattle. Paraphrasing, he stated:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Pets Vs Cattle: ‚ÄúWhen your pet gets sick you take it to the vet and you care for it, when your cow gets sick you take
		it out the back and shoot it‚Äù.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		He talked through CloudCall‚Äôs journey in moving to microservices, giving practical information on where to start
		your own microservices journey. This was an interesting discussion on how using an API gateway gives a centralised
		way into a microservice environment. It offers multiple benefits and shields the underlying application structure.
		This also means it can create a unifying umbrella while monolith to microservice migrations are undertaken.
	</p>
	<p>
		All in all, an interesting talk and a good chance to see how other people are solving problems that we had seen in
		different contexts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then it was time for the main event, the pizza break. I can confirm that, despite our best efforts, the pizza never
		ran out. It was a good chance to make connections and chat with the other attendees. For the first time I appreciated
		the ‚Äúice breakers‚Äù that we were forced to complete on teacher training, because at LeicesterJs people tended to stay
		in their familiar groups. It made me appreciate the way ice breaker games play the same role as a ‚ÄúChristmas cracker
		joke‚Äù. None of us are supposed to enjoy the ice breaker, we are all united against the ice breaker which forces you
		to form an alliance with the person you happen to be paired with, and means you do end up networking outside of your
		comfort zone.
	</p>
	<p>
		Either way, I had a lovely chat with Lizzie who had a similar back ground to me and pizza was enjoyed by all.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next chat was by our host Josh Ghent and was practical advice on how to refractor code. He introduced us to a
		host of cartoon characters to help us remember his advice, starting with ‚ÄúCody the code knight‚Äù. And moving to his
		three helpful friends with hands on examples

	<p>I always find at these events, the talks are springboards for discussion and it is in that time to share
		experiences with other practitioners that the real ‚Äújuicy‚Äù learning happens. At the end of each talk we were asked if
		we had any questions. A few people had things that they wanted to add. Software that they liked, or there was a part
		of the talk that they knew they had knowledge about that they could expand on. Starting the discussion with ‚Äúany
		questions‚Äù unfortunately did not lead to an opportunity to organically share this knowledge, and a statement such as
		‚Äùdoes anyone have anything to add‚Äù may have helped the flow here. As the group meets more often I am sure that people
		will feel more comfortable to add their own expertise, and next time I know that I need to make sure I network
		outside of the familiar faces so that I can make the best of the learning that I could have potentially done had I
		been brave! </p>
	<p>
		What struck me most about the event, was what a brilliant move by CloudCall it was. After the branded pizza arrived I
		was left wondering who had footed the bill. Throughout the event we were reminded that CloudCall are hiring and from
		what we had seen we were very impressed - what a clever way to get professionally engaged people to be aware of your
		company. The staff at CloudCall were there to talk favourably about their experiences of working with the company
		and share the exciting technologies they were able to work with. For the price of a pizza and beer, we had out of
		hours training for staff and a recruitment drive. An exceedingly worthwhile move and something worth replicating in
		the future!
	</p>
	<p>
		Overall definitely an evening worth attending, and a huge success considering it was the first meeting. On top of
		that, I only annoyed Adam once with my doodles in my notebook.
