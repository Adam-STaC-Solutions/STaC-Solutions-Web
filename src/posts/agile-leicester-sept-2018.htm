	<h2 style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Leicester Agile Meetup</h2>
	<p>On Thursday the 13th September, we attended the Leicester Agile meet up for a talk on how to implement a Kanban
		board to improve productivity in your team.</p>

	<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-around;"><img src="./images/posts/agile-leicester-sept-2018/Kanbanscreen.jpg" /></div>
	<p>This was a concept that I was completely new to, having only heard about it in conversation, so I was eager to see
		what I could learn about Kanban from our speaker Jon Terry.</p>
	<p>The evening was incredibly informative, Jon was very knowledgeable on the subject and spoke with enthusiasm and
		clarity.</p>
	<p>He gave practical advice on how to use a Kanban board in a team, highlighting many of the benefits that he had
		discovered through his own use. </p>
	<h4 style="margin-bottom: 50px;">What is a Kanban Board?</h4>
	<p>A Kanban board is a visual representation of how a piece of work progresses through different people, from its
		start to its completion. Jon made it clear that this board could take any form - from post its on the wall, to using
		a piece of software to create a Kanban board – with Jon preferring to use Leankit. </p>
	<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-around;"><img src="./images/posts/agile-leicester-sept-2018/kanbanboard.JPG" /></div>
	<p>To take a very simple example a board could have tasks to do, tasks being worked on, those in testing, and those
		completed. Each task would be on a “post it” or similar, and as it progresses, the team would move it to the correct
		category. Jon explained that once our board is up and running it was invaluable as a mechanism for identifying
		problems, so that then we can work on solving those problems and increasing the overall productivity of our
		department.</p>

	<blockquote>
		“[Kanban] is a means to an end, not an end its self.”
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Jon talked about cognition here saying that human evolution has been around a lot longer than our ability to read and
		write. We are much better at understanding pictures and visual representations than we are texts. Even more than
		that, I can add that when we ‘learned’ to read and write, instead of building completely new synapses we linked our
		ability to “travel” through a text onto the synapses we already created that process going on a journey. The visual
		representation here, and the way that we can see tickets “flowing through a journey” sits very well the way our
		brains are wired to understand information. This visual representation of a project is therefore more easily
		digestible by members of the team.
	</p>
	<h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Setting up a Kanban board.</h4>
	<p>
		Jon advised starting with a meeting in which everyone talks about who they get their work from, who they give it to –
		and what do they expect that person to do with it. This should be a starting point for creating our columns on our
		Kanban board. He advised that we don’t start making guesses about where the problems are in our process and try to
		create a Kanban board that shows what we think we would like the process to be. The Kanban board is going to help us
		identify that, and when we come to review it we should have a better idea of how we need to change it (if at all).
		This conversation will help dictate what our columns will be, and the order that they will go in. We should see the
		“flow” of a ticket from the first team that works on it of the left, moving to the last team, then completion on the
		right.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each person from each team should then choose a few items that they are working on to go up on the board. We don’t
		want to be spending ages making sure our board is perfect before we even start. It’s really in the using of the board
		that we’re going to work out the “best” way for our team to use the board.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Identifying and preventing problems.</h4>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, when it comes to start our scrum in the morning, we don’t need to have a discussion about who is doing what,
		because all of that information is available to us on the Kanban board. What we can now start to do in our scrum is
		identify the problems and use the time to talk about how the team can solve these problems. No time is wasted talking
		about the things that don’t need everyone’s attention.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are looking for places where post its/tickets are mounting up, or where tickets haven’t moved through as quickly
		as we would expect.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		“Our goal is to find root causes”
	</blockquote>
	<p>This should help us to see the places where the project is not moving as quickly as it can. In these instances, the
		answer is not going to be to pile on more work. Use the recourses that we have to solve the problems and get the
		projects moving forward.</p>
	<blockquote>
		“team mates can swarm to that problem”
	</blockquote>
	<p>I really liked this way of thinking, because I felt like it had a real team mentality behind it. We’re no longer
		starting new project upon new project. Actually, the important thing is that we are *finishing* projects, and by
		using the Kanban board the whole team can make sure that this is happening.</p>
	<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Setting limits.</h3>
	<p>One of the things that I found very interesting was the idea of setting upper limits on each column. It’s about
		identifying what work load each part of the team can viably work on at once, and making sure that we don’t exceed
		that work load. There is no point just piling on more and more work if nothing is getting finished. When you can see
		that the upper limit of the team that comes after you has been reached its time to stop doing new things. You can
		then use this time to then go and help in a place where tickets are getting stuck, or, Jon suggested, to upskill
		yourself but either way.</p>
	<p>Jon shared that, in every industry he had looked at it, no matter what the team structure, the longest that a
		tickets was ever “in one place” is when it had moved from one person, and was waiting to be actioned by the next.
		This is where we should be looking to cut down time, and setting upper limits is a good way to do that. If a member
		of a team already has three projects that they need to work on, a ticket is going to sit there until they have
		finished the other items that they are working. What the Kanban board allows us to do is ensure that the team is
		“slick” in the way that it is moving. </p>
	<p>Jon was confident, that time and time again what he has observed by setting these upper limits and working in this
		way, was an increase in the number of projects that were getting finished. </p>
	<p>The evening was so informative. I really felt that I came away with a firm understanding of how I could go into a
		setting and create a Kanban board, and how to effectively use it to make sure that my team were working to their best
		ability. </p>
	<p>I look forward to seeing what Agile Leicester brings next. </p>
