As software and its technical implementation becomes more complex, it becomes more difficult to hold the entire solution in memory. When systems reach this tipping point it becomes easier for simple mistakes to be made, and harder for people to approach and learn the system. It is at this point that documenting the core components and relationships becomes essential."

This could be across one of many levels; where software physically resides, the distinct applications that make up a solution, how components are internally structured, or even how business entities link from a logical perspective. With any of these scenarios, it requires the person doing the investigation to eventually have a comprehensive knowledge of the solution. This series of articles will look at some of the methods and tools that can be used to document and visualise architectures."

The main difference being that with GraphViz you define the objects and relationships as a set of coded rules. Additional style rules can be added retrospectively to enhance the generated diagram. With tools like <a href='https://draw.io/' > Draw.IO </a> or <a href='https://products.office.com/en-gb/visio/flowchart-software'>Microsoft Visio</a> the emphasis is on creating a diagram first. This means that you have to juggle the concepts and relationships, while also trying to draw and lay these out in a sensible way. With GraphViz it is also easier to then refer back to the ruleset that created the diagram. With flowchart tools it 's easy to corrupt the ruleset by accidently changing the layout."
